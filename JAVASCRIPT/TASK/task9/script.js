// Design a program to advise users on the best mobile data plan based on their
// monthly data usage in GB:
// * If the usage is less than five, suggest “Basic Plan.”
// * If the usage is between five and twenty, suggest “Standard Plan.”
// * If the usage is between twenty and fifty, suggest “Premium Plan.”
// * If the usage is above fifty, suggest “Unlimited Plan.”
// If the user's plan choice does not match their usage, show an alert message
// suggesting a better plan.
